These papers should be able to be compiled individually by executing:

  $  cd <DESIRED_CONFERENCE_FOLDER>
  $  make

Or, alternatively, all can be made at once by executing:

  $  ./make_all

The makefiles work by executing the proper sequence of latex commands and
should provide the most recent version possible (i.e. all bibtex references
updated, all figures in place, etc.).  If you are using an X login or are on
the machine natively, running make will cause Adobe Reader to launch with
the newly compiled paper by invoking:

  $  acroread <PDF_OUTPUT_FILENAME>

Note that if "acroread" is not in your path this will not work.  There may
also be issues with getting acroread to refresh properly.  To avoid this
behavior (but make the paper) simply type:

  $  make without-display

Other available options are:

  $  make view-dvi      # Relies on xdvi
  $  make print         # Relies on dvips
  $  make clean         # Full cleanup of output directory

Which may or may not work depending on your system installs (works on Zoo).
