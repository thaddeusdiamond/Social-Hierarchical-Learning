About This Project
==================
This project seeks to implement a new way for real robotic systems to learn
how to operate in complex environments alongside humans.

// TODO(Brad): Detailed description here...


License
=======
This software is licensed under the MIT License.  Please see "LICENSE".


Prerequisites
=============
  - GNU/Linux distro >= 2.6.37.6
  - G++ >= 4.5.1
  - Satisfy all dependencies of the following external libraries
      * GoogleTest      - Google's Unit Testing Framework
      * ProtocolBuffers - Google's Framework for Serializable PODS
  
  
Installation
============
In order to compile the external libraries associated with the project, please
run:
    $ ./install-ext

To compile the source, please run:
    $ make -C src

Three directories will be created: bin/, obj/ and logs/.

// TODO(Thad or Brad): Tell how to run each individual program once the programs
// are able to be executed.


Kinect
======
This project includes an external Kinect project that captures all data from the
Kinect running on a Windows 7+ device and transfers it on a wire to the core
processing unit, which can utilize the extra data to improve the learning
process. The only dependency for that project is the Microsoft Research Beta
SDK for Kinect.

The project makes the assumption that the Research SDK is installed to:
  C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Research KinectSDK

To build the executable, open "ext/Kinect/KinectInterp.sln" in Visual C++
(2010 or greater, any edition).  Click "Build Project", then "Start Debugging".
An executable will appear in the "Release" subdirectory of the Kinect project
root.


Documentation
=============
Documentation for this project is generated using Doxygen.  Please see
doc/DOXYGEN for details on how to compile documentation.  Documentation from the
master branch is available on the project website.
